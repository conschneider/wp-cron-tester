### Info
This plugin quickly answers the question **"Is my WordPress CRON service running ok?"**. 

It adds a test CRON job and displays debugging content on each single post page. 

On the single post page the timestamp of the test CRON job is displayed among with information whether CRON has been disabled or whether alternative CRON has been set.
